# Real-Time False Claim Detection System

## Introduction

In the era of rapid information dissemination, especially on social media and live broadcasts, false claims and misinformation spread quickly. Verifying the authenticity of such claims in real-time is critical to ensure that people are not misled by unreliable or fraudulent information, 
so there must be a solution developed to detect false information in real time. Our project addresses this challenge by developing an advanced real-time system that can detect and verify false claims across multiple data formats, such as live streams, videos, images, audio, and text.
